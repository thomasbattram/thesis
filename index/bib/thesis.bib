@article{Corbett2018,
abstract = {A large number of mutations in genes that encode RNA binding proteins cause human disease. Many of these RNA binding proteins mediate key steps in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression from mRNA processing to eventual decay in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, these RNA binding proteins, which are ubiquitously expressed and play fundamental roles in gene expression, are often altered in tissue-specific disease. Mutations linked to disease impact nearly every post-transcriptional processing step and cause diverse disease phenotypes in a variety of specific tissues. This review summarizes steps in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression that have been linked to disease providing specific examples of some of the many genes affected. Finally, recent advances that hold promise for treatment of some of these diseases are presented.},

abstract = {Genotype imputation is a key component of genetic association studies, where it increases power, facilitates meta-analysis, and aids interpretation of signals. Genotype imputation is computationally demanding and, with current tools, typically requires access to a high-performance computing cluster and to a reference panel of sequenced genomes. Here we describe improvements to imputation machinery that reduce computational requirements by more than an order of magnitude with no loss of accuracy in comparison to standard imputation tools. We also describe a new web-based service for imputation that facilitates access to new reference panels and greatly improves user experience and productivity.},
