## properties of ewas <a name="item1"></a>

Main question(s): Can we explain EWAS hits using available EWAS summary stats and could this be used to inform future study design?

Could change it so title is: Insights gained from the analysis of XXX EWAS. This would allow a description of the data and for it to be presented properly.

The results for the thesis chapter was kind of split into 3 sections:

1. A description of the catalog and associations in it (not answering main question)
2. How much are false positives likely contributing to results? (faulty probes, inclusion of certain covariates, replication rate)
3. Are there innate characteristics of the DNAm sites identified that make them more likely to be identified in EWAS? (h2, var, where they are in genome)

Technical difficulty with estimating R2 as we have winners curse. - could use Amanda Forde's package: https://github.com/amandaforde/winnerscurse/.

2 and 3 answer main question.

Replication needs thinking about - presentation and work-wise.
