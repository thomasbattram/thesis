# PhD project meeting notes 2022-02-09

Attendees: Tom B, Gib

## Agenda

* [h2ewas paper](#item1) 

## h2ewas paper <a name="item1"></a>

plan for the paper given pat leave??

* Could get rough response by end of Thursday (not including 1000 iterations) 
* OR just get it finished and submit once Tom G + Nic + Doug are happy? - (will send to them anyways)

Here is where I'm at: 

Have run analyses in all people and when removing relateds. Here are the [comparisons](new-cohorts-vs-fom1-estimates-with-unrelateds.png)

Interpretation: 5 of 7 estimates overlap with CIs from original analyses, however, results tend to be larger than 0. This suggests that variance captured by DNAm is still likely to be low (near to zero), it will vary a lot by trait (as concluded before) and as samples increase we can get a clearer view on the variance captured by DNAm across traits. Differences seen here may also reflect the timepoint difference. With the original FOM analyses we did not restrict phenotypes to one time point as that is not what is done in EWAS. However, here most of the measures are derived at the same time as DNAm is measured.

Questions:

1. Why do we have such small CIs for some?
2. I guess PC generation needs to be done each time I do an iteration? 
3. One tough thing a reviewer has a problem with is the "unexpected" values in the results - i.e. variance captured < 0. I think it's going to be hard to add anything extra to clarify this issue...
