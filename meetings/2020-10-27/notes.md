## Properties of EWAS major comments <a name="item1"></a>

* Variation of DNA methylation and effect size. Expect an association? Could variation in DNAm be selected for?

* Differences between hyper- and hypo-methylated probes

* Worth contrasting GWAS results of few samples to EWAS results of few samples?
	+ Nic Q: is there a contrast which follows power - going back to the infinite power experiment I have mentioned before - in that situation, do the EWAS and GWAS results become more similar as GWAS picks up the “environment” and confounding like EWAS… in contrast, as power falls away, GWAS becomes less able to pickup those really broad and polygenic contributions whilst EWAS still shows a footprint of confounders??

* Distribution of r<sup>2</sup> values -- large values for sum of r<sup>2</sup> suggests to me that the results are biased or some correlation structure driving up r<sup>2</sup>
	+ Would average r<sup>2</sup> for each site (which limits values in the r<sup>2</sup> range) be more appropriate?

* Limitations around replication
	+ Power of studies
	+ Reporting of top hits only 

* Partioning traits
