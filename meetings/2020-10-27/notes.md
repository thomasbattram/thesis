## Properties of EWAS major comments <a name="item1"></a>

* Variation of DNA methylation and effect size. Expect an association? Could variation in DNAm be selected for?
	+ we've only measured between cell-type variance -- just looking at the methylation level only you could be missing the trick...
	+ less variation means higher noise to signal ratio
	+ Frame this as an array design thing! 
	+ Speak to practical perspective and can then discuss the potential biological explanations later
	+ Look at whether replicated probes are also less variable

* Differences between hyper- and hypo-methylated probes
	+ Do you see more associations amongst EWAS in any particular direction? 
	+ Smoking may be an exception -- may need to partition traits!

* Worth contrasting GWAS results of few samples to EWAS results of few samples?
	+ Nic Q: is there a contrast which follows power - going back to the infinite power experiment I have mentioned before - in that situation, do the EWAS and GWAS results become more similar as GWAS picks up the “environment” and confounding like EWAS… in contrast, as power falls away, GWAS becomes less able to pickup those really broad and polygenic contributions whilst EWAS still shows a footprint of confounders?? -- something for discussion...


* Distribution of r<sup>2</sup> values -- large values for sum of r<sup>2</sup> suggests to me that the results are biased or some correlation structure driving up r<sup>2</sup>
	+ Would average r<sup>2</sup> for each site (which limits values in the r<sup>2</sup> range) be more appropriate?
	+ method for detecting inflated r<sup>2</sup> could maybe be improved by dividing sum(r<sup>2</sup>) by the sample size, then you're finding outliers based on having higher r<sup>2</sup> than expected for the sample size

* Limitations around replication
	+ Power of studies
	+ Reporting of top hits only 
	+ Given sample size of replication dataset (and assumption effect size is unbiased) -- know what expected effect size dist should be... -- Gib sending code for this! 

* Good to make the point that EWAS may be viewed as hypothesis-free, BUT the array was designed to pick up certain regions -- only 2% of sites!
