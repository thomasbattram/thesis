## sigma2_hm450 update <a name="item1"></a>

We have until February 14th now - increased time needed as bc4 is down.

PCs?? - Would it be best to calculate PCs on the 1000 children separately to the rest of the samples?


Repeating analyses - remove 1000 random people? or 1000 random non-related people? 

[prelim res](new-cohorts-vs-fom1-estimates.png) - without adjustment for PCs AND including relateds
