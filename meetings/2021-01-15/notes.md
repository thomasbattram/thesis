## Plans for each results chapter <a name="item1"></a>

### EWAS Catalog

* Submitting next week -- still working with the main team
* Data has also been updated - useful for other papers

### Properties of EWAS

* Need to re-run things with the new EWAS Catalog data 
* Also Matt and Paul made a great point about another set of analysis that should be run
* This hasn't been written in paper-format yet so will likely take the longest to get moving

### h2ewas

* Need to make some minor changes based on the comments from viva examiners + Josine.
* Josine made the point that results could be confounded by genotype, but I don't think we need to add in genotype to the analyses because evidence suggests that genotype confounds things towards the null anyway
* Someone also took offence to us saying "EWAS" yield few associations
* Will submit to AJHG very soon after making changes -- worth doing pre-submission enquiry?
* May have to change format if AJHG reject it

### ewas-gwas comparison

* Need to re-run things with new EWAS Catalog data
* Apart from that, I don't think there were many comments on this so happy to submit/put it on biorxiv after I've re-run the analyses
* Where to submit? -- Nat Comms or Genome Biology?
* 

### DNAm-lung cancer 

* Published
