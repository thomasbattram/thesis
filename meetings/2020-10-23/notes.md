## ewas-gwas comparison v2 <a name="item1"></a>

* How can I replace pathway in intro/discussion? -- feels weird to use pathway throughout and then in the main analyses use a database that isn't technically a pathway database...

* Justifying why confounding/reverse causation is reason that EWAS and GWAS may differ -- if all DNAm sites have a genetic component (???) then would a GWAS large enough capture genes captured by EWAS? 
	+ also is it enough in the intro to put differences in EWAS and GWAS likely mean EWAS results due to confounding/reverse causation and then explain other options in the discussion?

* Tom suggested filtering out big pathways as a sensitivity analyses but how?? -- looking at the data it seems... 

* In the paper I talk about overlap between "causal" and "non-causal" genes, but technically speaking a gene can't be causal and non-causal... 

* Don't understand one of Nic's comments (not mentioning mediation -- in discussion) -- that's the only part I discuss the results of all GWAS vs. all GWAS vs. 7 EWAS.

* Tom mentioned "reverse causality" is dismissed as a bad thing...
