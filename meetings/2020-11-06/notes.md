Attendees: Tom B, Gib

## Agenda

* [Finishing thesis](#item1) 
* [Item2](#item2)
* [AOB](#aob)

## Finishing thesis <a name="item1"></a>

* Sending over things to check
	+ Chapter summaries
	+ Abstract
	+ Contribution statements
	+ etc.

* Inconsistencies between chapters/justifying decisisons made by others (or made 3 years ago)
	+ Thresholds needed -- explain why they are needed and what the thresholds chosen were arbitrary, but with reasons:
		+ P < 1e-4 -- less stringent than conventional threshold as wanted to be able to see replication across studies, but not too lenient as that would be computationally difficult to handle
		+ N > 100 -- wanted to be low enough to include studies of rarer phenotypes and in less studied samples (e.g. non-Europeans), but didn't want to include studies that were very underpowered
		+ ncpg > 100,000
	+ Need broad reasons for arbritrary choices -- have a reason for each one!
