# PhD project meeting notes 2021-03-12

Attendees: Tom B, Gib

## Agenda

* [ewas-gwas comparison paper](#item1) 
* [Item2](#item2)
* [AOB](#aob)

## ewas-gwas comparison paper <a name="item1"></a>

### New traits

Only 6 more traits - lots more EWAS of N>4500, but just weren't viable

Excluded some new studies due to trait duplication and excluded an EWAS of homocysteine GRS/single mutation

### Overlap results

[region overlap plot](all_traits_overlap_bar.pdf)

New [gene overlap table](gene-overlap-tab.png)

New [geneset overlap table](geneset-overlap-tab.png)

Interesting that there is overlap for diastolic and systolic blood pressure! - suggests that EWAS may be picking up some causal genes more than expected by chance. 

### 14 ewas vs. all gwas

Data available on the open gwas project website isn't available in the vcf files on bc4 - at least not at the normal path: .../public/GWAS-ID/

It's just biobank japan and ieu-b data

Running the new ewas traits through these scripts there weren't any associations greater than expected by chance

### Rest of analyses

Final simulations running on bc3 - takes roughly 6 days

Then can write up new results and send out
