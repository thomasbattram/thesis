## Properties of ewas analyses <a name="item1"></a>

Expected replication:

We have Beta, SE, P, N in discovery and N in replication

Can estimate whether the sample size in replication is high enough to be able to detect an effect (assuming the effect + SD are the same in the replication). Could also check the sample size is high enough to detect an effect if the true effect is actually at the lower end of the CI.

This would give us X expected replications across the studies and I'd just do a binomial test to see if the actual replications are as great or greater than the expected replications? 

How many axes of phenotypic space does CpG associate with? 
450,000 CpGs by 2000 traits matrix - any cells where data is missing can be set to 0.
